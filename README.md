## HOW TO USE

* Should compile with simple python build.py
* Arrow keys + RSHIFT and RCTRL to move the 8-sided shape and dig through the cube
* Hold W for wireframe view
* Press R to reset the cube
* Click and drag to rotate the cube
* Hold X for another interesting way to carve the cube :)

## NOTES

* In my video my cube's resolution is 25x25x25. This is pushing my laptop to its limits; for this submission I put it slightly down to 20x20x20 so that I don't burn anyone's computer.
* Requires an environment with pthread support (because that's all that would work on my environment!)
* Works when built with O3 level optimizations.
* Works best when built on Linux (requires g++, not tested on Windows or Mac)
